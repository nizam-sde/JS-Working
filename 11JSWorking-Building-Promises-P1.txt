// we are going to build our own promise
// if promises were never existed in JS , to khud ka promise banate hum log
// we are doing this just to improve our logic in js regarding andling asynchronous operations 
// like API calls, file loading, or time delays easier.

// Promise - A Promise in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) 
//           of an asynchronous operation.
// Promise ke only 3 state hote hai, pending, resolved, rejected

// its like maine bola aaj bahar ka mausam kaisa hai, but you are inside how and does'nt know the
// whether condition so you game me a promise ki mein check krke aata hu fir aapko pakka batanuga
// whether isiko promise kehte hai JavaScript me, when you came back after and shared the details
// you set the state of promise fullfiled by your end by answering me the whether

// syntax example for promise -

function pizzaKhilaDo() {
    return new Promise( (resolve, reject) =>{
            // your logic code goes here
            resolve(value) //here we pass the value with res, rej as per desired need
    })
}

pizzaKhilaDo()  //calling function
    .then( () => {})      //resolve hone pr kya kre we pass here
    .catch( (err) =>{})   // error ke case me kya show krna hai ya kya message bhejna hai we do with it
    .finally( ()=>{})     // finally we use to declear our last verdict or direction what we want to share

    // above was the complete syntax of uses of promise in js

    //in the next part2 of this chapter we will see our own buit promise
